# Project01-FunctionsInC
First project for the UT Austin Embedded Systems Online Course

Objective:
Write a function that accepts 2 inputs (length and width in meters) and calculates the area of the rectangular room 
in squared meters. As a constraint, the program should only calculate the area of the room if the magnitude of the 
width and length parameters is between 3m and 20m. Satisfying this requirement will return the calculated area of
the room. On the other hand, if the requirement is not met, the function should return 0.
